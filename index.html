      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_6982.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I was born to Chinese immigrants, Yip and Su, and was raised in Belize, a small
        Central American country neighboring Guatemala. Since I was a small child,
        I was taught how to speak several languages in order to communicate with
        those around me.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for the childhood that I had because I was
        surrounded by different cultures and learned to appreciate the different walks
        of life that people come from. At the age of 13, my family and I relocated to Brooklyn, NY where we lived
        for 3 years before making Washington our home.</p>

      <p>After working retail for 8 years, I joined the corporate world working in Sales Operations
        for a start up company specializing in developing telematics and software for fleet management.
        In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, hiking, finding every swimming hole that
        Washington has to offer and riding on the back of my husband's Harley,
        granted the weather is nice. I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends
        or staying in on rainy Washington nights and watching horror movies.</p>
